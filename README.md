## Features

- Cars navigate through a track with various checkpoints.
- The cars have sensors to detect the track boundaries and avoid collisions.
- The simulation uses a genetic algorithm to evolve the cars' neural network brains.
- Cars are rewarded based on their performance, including the number of checkpoints reached and the time taken to complete the track.
- The simulation supports multiple tracks and customizable parameters.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the source code.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
pip install pygame pillow


## Usage

1. Run the `main.py` file using Python:

2. The simulation will start, and you will see the cars navigating through the track.
3. The simulation will run for multiple generations, and the cars will learn to improve their performance over time.
4. Once the simulation is complete, the results, including the best-performing cars, will be displayed.

## Customization

You can customize various aspects of the simulation by modifying the variables in the code. Some of the customizable parameters include:

- Window size
- Pixel size
- Track layout
- Number of cars
- Neural network parameters
- Mutation rate

Feel free to experiment with different settings to observe the impact on the car's performance and learning behavior.

## Acknowledgements

The implementation of this simulation is inspired by the concepts of genetic algorithms and neural networks. It builds upon the Pygame library for graphics and user interface.
